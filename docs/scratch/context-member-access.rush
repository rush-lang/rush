## Contextual member access

class foo
public
	let value = 0

	func method()
		## current context of the expression is the
		## class instance, thus the expression resolves to
		## this.value
		return .value

## Left hand side of the expression is of type
## declaration_kind so the contextual resolution of
## the type member access on the right resolves to that

get is_undeclared
	=> resolve_declaration().kind == .undeclared

get is_overloaded
	=> resolve_declaration().kind == .overloaded
