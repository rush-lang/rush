## fix: use prior ignored indentation
## that has yet to be dedented
## could be achieved by 'pinning' the depth
## of indentation at 'func' and checking
## the difference when indentation is relevant.
func add(
	a,
	b: int)
	return a + b


## === Segmentation fault. =====================
let f(x: int) =>  ## figure out fault, fix + implement
	return x^2		## multi-line lambda's.
